It caches only the response of those calls which determined in `config`\n * 2. It doesn't cache responses which returned error\n * 3. The value is requested by BinarySocket,\n *    if this returns a value according to the logic here, socket code take it as response\n *    but also triggers an async `send` request, to keep the cache updated for next time\n * 4. Uses client's time to set and check for expiry, as the expire durations are not so long to need a more precise one\n *    (And doesn't worth to wait for the response of time call)\n * 5. Some responses should be cached by a particular value from request (e.g. contracts_for_frxAUDJPY)\n *    so there can be more than one value for a particular call\n * 6. Clears the whole cache regardless their expire time on the following events:\n *    6.1. Client changes: login / logout / switch loginid\n *    6.2. Detect a new release (static hash changed)\n */\nvar SocketCache = function () {\n    // keys are msg_type\n    // expire: how long to keep the value (in minutes)\n    // map_to: if presents, stores the response based on the value of the provided key in the echo_req\n    var config = {\n        payout_currencies: { expire: 10 },\n        active_symbols: { expire: 10, map_to: ['product_type', 'landing_company'] },\n        contracts_for: { expire: 10, map_to: ['contracts_for', 'product_type', 'currency'] }\n    };\n\n    var storage_key = 'ws_cache';\n\n    var data_obj = {};\n\n    var set = function set(response) {\n        var msg_type = response.msg_type;\n\n        if (!config[msg_type]) return;\n\n        // prevent unwanted page behaviour\n        // if a cached version already exists but it gives an error after being called for updating the cache\n        if ((response.error || !response[msg_type]) && get(response.echo_req)) {\n            clear();\n            window.location.reload();\n            return;\n        }\n\n        var key = makeKey(response.echo_req, msg_type);\n        var expires = moment().add(config[msg_type].expire, 'm').valueOf();\n\n        if (!data_obj.static_hash) {\n            data_obj.static_hash = getStaticHash();\n        }\n\n        data_obj[key] = { value: response, expires: expires };\n        LocalStore.setObject(storage_key, data_obj);\n    };\n\n    var get = function get(request, msg_type) {\n        var response = void 0;\n\n        if (isEmptyObject(data_obj)) {\n            data_obj = LocalStore.getObject(storage_key);\n            if (isEmptyObject(data_obj)) return undefined;\n        }\n\n        if (data_obj.static_hash !== getStaticHash()) {\n            // new release\n            clear();\n        }\n\n        var key = makeKey(request, msg_type);\n        var response_obj = getPropertyValue(data_obj, key) || {};\n\n        if (moment().isBefore(response_obj.expires)) {\n            response = response_obj.value;\n        } else {\n            // remove if expired\n            remove(key);\n        }\n\n        return response;\n    };\n\n    var makeKey = function makeKey(source_obj, msg_type) {\n        var key = msg_type || Object.keys(source_obj).find(function (type) {\n            return config[type];\n        });\n\n        if (key && !isEmptyObject(source_obj)) {\n            ((config[key] || {}).map_to || []).forEach(function (map_key) {\n                key += map_key ?
